# üö¶ Handlers in Ansible

---

## What are Handlers?

Handlers are special tasks that **run only when notified** by another task. They are typically used to perform actions that should occur only if a change is made ‚Äî for example, restarting a service only if a configuration file changes.

Think of them as ‚Äúdelayed reactions‚Äù triggered when needed.

---

## Why use Handlers?

- Prevent unnecessary restarts or reloads.
- Ensure services are only impacted when changes are actually made.
- Improve performance and idempotency.

## Basic Handler Example

```yaml
- name: Install and configure Apache
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Update config file
      copy:
        src: apache.conf
        dest: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
