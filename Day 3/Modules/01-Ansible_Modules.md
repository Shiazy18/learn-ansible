# ðŸ“˜ Day 3: Ansible Modules

---

## What Are Ansible Modules?

Ansible **modules** are the building blocks of Ansible.  
They are **small programs** (usually Python scripts) that run on the **target machines** (managed nodes) to perform specific tasks like installing packages, managing files, users, services, etc.

When you write a task in a playbook, you're essentially calling a module with specific arguments.

---

## Types of Modules

- **Core Modules** â€“ Officially supported by Ansible and included by default.
- **Extras Modules** â€“ Community-maintained modules.
- **Custom Modules** â€“ You can create your own in Python or other languages.
- **Cloud Modules** â€“ Specialized modules to manage cloud resources (e.g., Azure, AWS).

---

## How Modules Work

- Playbooks contain **tasks** that invoke **modules**.
- When you run a playbook:
  - Ansible copies the module code to the remote node.
  - Executes the module via **SSH** (or WinRM for Windows).
  - Removes the module after execution.
- Ansible is **agentless**â€”no software needs to be installed on the target host.

## Commonly Used Modules

| Module         | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `file`         | Create/delete files, set permissions        |
| `copy`         | Copy files from control to managed nodes    |
| `template`     | Deploy Jinja2 templates                     |
| `command`      | Run commands on remote hosts (no shell)     |
| `shell`        | Run shell commands (use with caution)       |
| `debug`        | Print variables/messages for debugging      |
| `lineinfile`   | Manage lines in text files                  |
| `stat`         | Get file or path information                |

## User Management

```yaml
- name: Add user
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: devops
    shell: /bin/bash

- name: Add SSH key for devops
  ansible.builtin.authorized_key:
    user: devops
    key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
```

## Package Management

- Use apt for Debian/Ubuntu
- Use yum or dnf for Red Hat/CentOS

```yaml
- name: Install nginx using apt
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
```

## Service Management

```yaml
- name: Start nginx service
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```

## Tips

- Always use modules instead of shell/command when available.
- Modules are idempotent, you can run them multiple times safely.
- Check module docs with:

```php
ansible-doc <module_name>
```

# User Management in Ansible

## Overview

Ansible makes it easy to **create**, **delete**, and **manage user accounts** across multiple systems.  
This is done using the **`user`** and **`authorized_key`** modules.

These modules are **idempotent**, meaning repeated runs won't create duplicate users or re-apply the same SSH key unnecessarily.

---

## Creating a User

```yaml
- name: Create a user named 'devops'
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: devops
    state: present
    shell: /bin/bash
```

---

## Deleteing a User

```yaml
- name: Remove user 'devops'
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: devops
    state: absent
    remove: yes   # This removes the home directory too

```

---

## Adding SSH Public Key

```yaml
- name: Add SSH key for 'devops'
  ansible.builtin.authorized_key:
    user: devops
    state: present
    key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
```

---

## Changing User Properties

```yaml
- name: Change shell and comment for user
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: devops
    shell: /bin/zsh
    comment: "DevOps Engineer"
```

---

## Managing Home Directory

```yaml
- name: Create user with specific home directory
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: devuser
    home: /data/devuser
    create_home: yes

```

---

## Managing Password

- Use mkpasswd --method=sha-512 or openssl passwd -6 to generate password hash.

```yaml
- name: Set user password (hashed)
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: devuser
    password: "$6$rounds=5000$mysalt$g6Rgq...."
```

- Use mkpasswd --method=sha-512 or openssl passwd -6 to generate password hash.

---

## Best Practice

- Avoid using plaintext passwords in playbooks.
- Use variables and vault to store secrets.
- Prefer SSH key authentication over password login.
- Always test user creation on a non-production host first.
