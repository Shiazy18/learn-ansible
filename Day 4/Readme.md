# Day 4: Advanced Ansible Concepts

Welcome to **Day 4** of your Ansible learning journey! Today we’ll dive into more **advanced concepts** that are crucial when building real-world, scalable, and secure automation workflows.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Roles

- Learn how to structure your playbooks using roles.
- Break down your tasks, variables, handlers, and templates into reusable components.
- Scaffold roles using `ansible-galaxy init`.

➡️ Refer: [roles.md](./Roles.md)

---

### 2. Vault

- Secure your sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or API keys using `ansible-vault`.
- Learn to encrypt and decrypt files.
- Use vaults within your playbooks and roles.

➡️ Refer: [vault.md](./vault.md)

---

### 3. Custom Modules

- Understand how Ansible modules work under the hood.
- Learn to write your own custom Python modules if required for special use cases.

➡️ Refer: [custom_modules.md](./custom_modules.md)

---

### 4. Lookups and Filters

- Dynamically fetch data from files, environment variables, or external sources using **lookups**.
- Use **filters** to transform variables (e.g., to_upper, regex, join, etc.).

➡️ Refer: [lookups_filters.md](./lookups_filters.md)

---

### 5. Facts and Register Variables

- Use **facts** to gather system information dynamically.
- Capture output of tasks using **register** and use it for conditional logic and dynamic tasks.

➡️ Refer: [facts_register.md](./facts_register.md)

---

## Objective

By the end of Day 4, you'll be able to:

- Structure complex automation code using **roles**
- Manage secrets securely using **Ansible Vault**
- Understand and use **custom modules**, **lookups**, and **filters**
- Make your playbooks dynamic and responsive using **facts** and **register**

---

Pro Tip: These concepts are heavily used in production environments and interviews. Practice creating modular, dynamic, and secure playbooks!
